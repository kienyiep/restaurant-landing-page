        Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
        It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
        So it is a css reset that make the css looks the same in all browser

        The header is where we will put the logo, the navigation, the hero image,
        the main heading and those buttons that I showed you in the image before. 
         
        The header element works bascially like a usual div element, 
        which mean that is a container to put some content. 
        There are other element like that such as nav for navigation, footer element for the footer, 
        and the main element for the main content.

        By using the header element, instead of simple div element, we tell serach engine such as google
        this is our header, and not some simple div element with no meanig, so this give our container a meaning.
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
        <header>
           <!-- The nav element is where the navigation and button will go. 
           Now to center everything inside of the navigation, I will use a row.

             <!-- here is the nav element, where we will use the j query to add the sticky class.  -->

                    <!-- The navigation is usually using so called unordered list. 
                    unordered list is just like some bullet point,
                    where each bullet points will be an element of the  navigation. -->

                        <!-- each of the list element will be the a link,

                  <!-- form is like a group of input elements, and we have an html element where we need to put all of them
                  and this element is called form element. 
                  It need to have couple of attribute, one is method, but it is not relevant to us in this case,
                  as it is needed when we send this form which will require a lot of programming and other languages,
                  and we will not talk about this in this course. 
                  Hence, in this course, we will only format this form, but we will not able to send anything from it.  -->

                  <!-- The another attribute that we need to define is the action, which is like a link, 
                       the action could be the script which handle how the form will be sent. -->

                       <!-- we will use a php file, which will be a script, hosted on our server. 
                       this script will be executed once the user clicks on the submit button.  -->

                      and each of those row, we will then have our different input element. 
                      So one column for the label, for example: name, email address, etc.
                      and then one column for the input element. -->
                    <div class="row">
                        <!-- here is the special one, as we want one column to be bigger than the other one.  -->

                        <!-- the id is created in the below column is because 
                            here in the label we can use the for attribute and then put the name of the ID here, 
                            which will then link the label with the input, which mean if we click on the label, the field will be automatically selected.
                            and it only with on the text form and select element, it does not work in the check box and text area -->
                            <label for="name">Name</label>

                            and the type will be text. In each of those, we should also give those a name, cause the name will be used to send the form. I will also define the ID here which also is the name
                            The another interesting is the place holder, the placeholder is the text appeared inside the text field
                            before we write anything.  
                            The last thing is we can just add this key word required.
                            If we do so, the browser will not allow us to send the form without completing this field. 
                            which is very handly.
